# cscope cpus

`cscope cpus` shows information about how many cpu cores are available. If its on a Slurm cluster it shows information about every partition, if not, it defaults to the local node.

## Slurm

```shell
$ cscope cpus
CPU information:
  partition: cpu, cpu_count: 192
  partition: h100, cpu_count: 192
  partition: h200, cpu_count: 192
```

## Slurm Partition Filter

You can also pass an optional partition arg: `... --partition=<partition-name>`, if partition is passed it limits the `cscope cpus` for only that Slurm partition.

```shell
$ cscope cpus --partition=h100
CPU information:
  partition: h100, cpu_count: 192
```

## Local Node

```shell
âžœ cscope cpus
CPU information:
  cpu_count: 16
```
