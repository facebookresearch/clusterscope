# Contributing to clusterscope

## Development Workflow

### Environment setup

Running the below from the root of this repository brings [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), all required development dependencies, and installs clusterscope in editable mode:

```bash
make install-dev-requirements
```

This should get you started with a binary and library available in your local environment:

```bash
$ python
>>> import clusterscope
>>> clusterscope.cluster()
'<your-cluster-name>'
```

```bash
$ cscope
usage: cscope [-h] {info,cpus,gpus,check-gpu,aws} ...
...
```

### `pre-commit`

We have all linters/formatters/typecheckers integrated into pre-commit, these checks are also running as part of github CI. pre-commit automates part of the changes that will be required to land code on the repo. You can run the below to activate pre-commit in your local env:

```
pre-commit install
```

### Requirements

If you update the requirements, make sure to add it [`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml)'s appropriate section for the dependency. Then you can run the below to update the requirements file:

```
$ make requirements.txt:
```

For development dependencies:

```
$ make dev-requirements.txt:
```
